<h3 class="subtitle">Scans</h3>
<p>
Before you begin your USM journey, you should know where you are.
</p>

<p>
We can analyze your current situation using USM scans. If we scan your current situation before the project, you can use the results to
demonstrate the business value the project may provide to your organization. We can also do the scan later, in the initial phase of the
deployment project.
</p>

<p>
There are multiple types of scans, with varying depths and scopes, depending on the needs of the organization. USM scans use a mix
of surveys, interviews and reviews of existing documentation and tools. The result is typically presented in a form of a report.
</p>

<p>
Quick scan can also be done as a self-assessment, using an Excel template or an online form.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Coaching</h3>

<p>
Your organization should become self-sufficient in providing the USM. Our coaches can help you in your path towards self-sufficiency, with various
forms of knowledge transfer, such as informal training and coaching. We can also set you up with more formal USM training if needed.
</p>

<p>
We are flexible, but typically avoid consulting, deployment work and project management, because they do not help you to become self-sufficient.

<h3 class="subtitle">Tooling</h3>

<p>
Tooling is an integral part of the USM deployment project and will play a major part in its success.
</p>

<p>
Existing systems may need to be integrated, or you may need to build or purchase new ones.
</p>

<p>
We can help you in evaluating suitability of your current systems in terms of USM features,
evaluating alternatives, or implementing the necessary custom tools, integrations and glue between systems.
</p>

<div class="col col-md-12 col-lg-6" style="padding-left: 20px">
<h3 class="subtitle">Audit Support</h3>

<p>
We are developing a set of tools to assist you in various kinds of service management audits that target
frameworks and certifications, such as ITIL v4, ISO 27k, ISO 20k, COBIT. We can provide your auditors with
cross-references between USM and the target framework or certification.
</p>

<p>
Contact us for details.
</p>

<p>
We do not do audits or provide you with certifications.

<h3 class="subtitle">Training</h3>
<p>
USM challenges how you think about service management, and the necessary paradigm shift you need to
experience cannot happen by simply reading white papers or listening to podcasts. Probably the best
method to really learn about USM is to take the USM Foundations course.
</p>

<p>
The length of the course is two
days, and it comes in two variantes, either four half days or four full days. On this intensive course,
you will learn to become self-sufficient to start piloting the USM method in your organization.
</p>

<p>
There are currently no open public USM Foundation courses taught by Mikko Ahonen.
Contact us for private USM Foundation courses for your organization or participation in private
USM courses.

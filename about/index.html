Today all business are service businesses. Even if you are just selling
potatoes, you will legally need to provide a support for returning the bad
ones.
</p>

<p>
For many companies it is not enough to just provide services. They see the need
to become customer-driven in order to survive in a competitive market. To
become customer-driven, you need to focus on the long-term relationship with the
customer, instead of only looking at individual transactions. This means that
how you manage your services needs some new thinking as well.
</p>

<p>
The USM method provides a standardized management method for a service
organization to manage its people, its processes, its technology, and its
services.

<p>
USM is different from frameworks and standards, such as ISO 20000-1, COBIT or
ITIL, which are collections of best practices.  USM is built on principles
inspired by those practices. USM does not compete with these standards and
frameworks, but is complementary to them.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if you need certifications for your business, USM is probably the
fastest, least expensive, least risky, and probably even the most useful way to
do it. After you deploy USM, the auditors can cross-reference
certification requirements to the activities in workflows, profiles and other specifications
of the USM, to demonstrate compliancy.

<p>
The USM Method was authored by USM Chief Architect Jan van Bon. Jan has
extensive exprience in Service Management, including being a member of the ITIL
v3 guidance team between 2006-2007. Jan became increasingly frustrated with
the complexity of common standards and frameworks, including ITIL and various
ISO standards, and started developing a more simplified method for service
management, based on principles. USM is the result of that work.
</p>

<p>
The USM Method was developed and is owned and managed by the SURVUZ Foundation
in Netherlands.
